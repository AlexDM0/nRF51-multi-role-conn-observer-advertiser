<a name="timeslot-advertiser---observer" class="anchor" href="#timeslot-advertiser---observer"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TIMESLOT ADVERTISER - OBSERVER</h1>

<p>This project utilizes the Concurrent Multi-protocol Timeslot API in the Nordic
Semiconductor S110 v7.0 SoftDevice for the   nRF51-series micro-controllers to run a
scannable advertiser concurrently with the SoftDevice.</p>

<p>This project also contains an example to run a concurrent multi-protocol 
observer concurrently with the Softdevice.</p>

<p>The Timeslot advertiser and scanner accept a subset of the HCI command interface to
control various parameters of their behaviour.</p>

<p>Scan Requests that arrive at the advertiser are also sent to the application.
The scan requests are sent with the address, RSSI, channel and an experimental
link quality indicator.</p>

<p>The experimental link quality indicator that counts the number of packets with
CRC failures and the number packets with successful CRC has been addeed.
This allows the application to have some awareness of the link quality.
The link quality is returned by the observer and by the scannable advertiser.</p>

<h2>
<a name="required-software" class="anchor" href="#required-software"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Required Software</h2>

<p>S110 v7.0 production Softdevice</p>

<p>nRF51 SDK v6.0</p>

<p>Copy the folders in this github repo to the s110 folder in the nRF51 SDK</p>

<h2>
<a name="example-code" class="anchor" href="#example-code"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example code</h2>

<p>The project contains an example of usage, where the Timeslot advertiser runs
with an advertisement interval of 100ms, along with a SoftDevice powered
connectable advertiser with an advertisement interval of 150ms. </p>

<h2>
<a name="timeslot-advertiser-interface" class="anchor" href="#timeslot-advertiser-interface"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Timeslot Advertiser: Interface</h2>

<p>The timeslot advertiser interface is based on the Bluetooth standard HCI
interface, but only implements a small subset of the functionality. All
interface functions are found in the ts_advertiser.h file under include/.</p>

<h3>
<a name="report-queue" class="anchor" href="#report-queue"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Report queue</h3>

<p>The timeslot advertiser offers reports related to radio activity to the user.
The software interrupt indicated by the user in the btle_hci_adv_init()
function is triggered when there are available reports in the queue. The user
may then use the btle_hci_adv_report_get() function to pull reports from the
queue. The reports contains total valid/invalid packets received and an HCI
btle_evt_t that indicates what kind of event triggered this report. </p>

<p>NOTE: The BLE specification does not define any scan report events, so a special event
type was added for this: BTLE_VS_EVENT_NRF_SCAN_REQUEST_RECEIVED. It contains
an address and address type of the scanner in addition to RSSI and channel.</p>

<h3>
<a name="available-function-calls" class="anchor" href="#available-function-calls"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Available function calls:</h3>

<p><strong>void btle_hci_adv_init(IRQn_Type btle_hci_adv_evt_irq);</strong></p>

<p>Initialize the timeslot advertiser. The IRQ parameter decides which software
interrupt to use for the generated events. For each report the advertiser
generates, the selected IRQ flag will be set, and the user may get events from
the queue using btle_hci_adv_evt_get().</p>

<hr><p><strong>bool btle_hci_adv_report_get(nrf_report_t* report);</strong></p>

<p>Function for getting pending tsa reports. It is recommended to repeat this
function until it returns false, as there may be more than one pending report
in the queue.</p>

<hr><p><strong>void btle_hci_adv_sd_evt_handler(uint32_t event);</strong></p>

<p>SoftDevice event handler for the timeslot advertiser. Takes any timeslot event
generated by SoftDevice function sd_evt_get(). </p>

<hr><p><strong>void btle_hci_adv_params_set(btle_cmd_param_le_write_advertising_parameters_t* adv_params);</strong></p>

<p>Set the advertisement parameters for the timeslot advertiser. See hci/btle.h
for details about the struct parameter</p>

<hr><p><strong>void btle_hci_adv_enable(btle_adv_mode_t adv_enable);</strong></p>

<p>Enable or disable advertisement</p>

<hr><p><strong>void btle_hci_adv_data_set(btle_cmd_param_le_write_advertising_data_t* adv_data);</strong></p>

<p>Set the content of the timeslot advertiser advertisement packets. This does not
include any headers or address, as this is controlled internally. To set the
advertisement address, use the btle_hci_adv_params_set() function.</p>

<hr><p><strong>void btle_hci_adv_scan_rsp_data_set(btle_cmd_param_le_write_scan_response_data_t* scan_rsp);</strong></p>

<p>Set the content of the timeslot advertiser scan response packet. This is the
packet the beacon will send to respond to external scan requests.  This does
not include any headers or address, as this is controlled internally.  To set
the advertisement address, use the btle_hci_adv_params_set() function.</p>

<hr><p><strong>void btle_hci_adv_whitelist_add(btle_cmd_param_le_add_device_to_whitelist_t* whitelist_device);</strong></p>

<p>Add a scanner to the device whitelist. If the whitelist filter is enabled, only
scanners on this whitelist will be accepted. </p>

<p>The filter can be enabled with the btle_hci_adv_params_set() function above.</p>

<hr><p><strong>void btle_hci_adv_whitelist_remove(btle_cmd_param_le_remove_device_from_whitelist_t* whitelist_device);</strong></p>

<p>Remove a scanner from the device whitelist. If the whitelist filter is enabled,
only scanners on this whitelist will be accepted. </p>

<p>The filter can be enabled with the btle_hci_adv_params_set() function above.</p>

<hr><p><strong>void btle_hci_adv_whitelist_flush(void);</strong></p>

<p>Remove all scanners from the device whitelist. If the whitelist filter is
enabled, only scanners on this whitelist will be accepted. </p>

<p>The filter can be enabled or disabled with the btle_hci_adv_params_set()
function above.  Note that this function does not disable the filter
functionality.</p>

<hr><h2>
<a name="timeslot-observer-interface" class="anchor" href="#timeslot-observer-interface"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Timeslot Observer: Interface</h2>

<p>The timeslot Observer interface is also based on the Bluetooth standard HCI
interface, but only implements a small subset of the functionality. All
interface functions are found in the nrf_scan.h file under include/.</p>

<p>The interface documenation for the Observer will be added in the next release.</p>
